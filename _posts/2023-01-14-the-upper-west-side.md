## review

For this review, we decided to do something new. 

So far, we've been exploring the Chipotle locations in Lower Manhattan. However, given the oft-quoted adage "new year, new me", we thought we ought to explore a new area  with the intention of bringing both new locations and new flavours to our readers.  

We wanted something crazy - an experience to show our readers that we were willing to risk it all for the review. Something that would befit the storied halls of legend, heretofore occupied by the likes of Norgay, and Shackleton, and Drake, and Cousteau. 

We decided to brave the feared MTA system. We decided to chart the uncharted. We decided to explore the unknown. We decided to go to the Upper West Side. 

Here’s the thing though - anyone can get on a train going to the Upper West Side. But can anyone do it at night? Would you? Perhaps not. To elevate the stakes, our writers travelled after dusk to get you the inside scoop.

This Chipotle ™ , located on 83rd street, finds itself close to the 1,B, and, C trains, as well as the M104 bus. It’s a good thing too since given the generous portions, eating a complete bowl at this location will render you unable to walk more than a few blocks. 

My typical order used to be (double) white rice, (double) black beans, fajitas, spicy salsa, corn salsa, sour cream, lettuce, guacamole, and cheese. However, day in and day out of the same order can be laborious. As I approached the till, I mustered the courage to do something different - to be someone different. I opted for the (double) brown rice - just audacious enough for a novelty, just pragmatic enough for my colon. 

As I watched the chef prepare the macédoine that crested the top of my bowl, I hoped that they might forget to charge me for the tortilla. Never before have I been graced with that divine blessing - that absolution that convinces me that He is real - that free galette. But as we neared closer and closer to the till, the genius of Dusty Springfield’s 1964 hit befell me and I was struck with that same feeling, simply wishin’ and hopin’. 

They say that optimism is the psychological alchemy of turning belief into reality. I believe I read that on Twitter. Or Pornhub. It’s hard to tell where inspiration comes from but I’d personally say it’s 50-50 Twitter and Pornhub right now. Perhaps it was because of Him, perhaps it was the magic in the air, or perhaps it was simply just the Live Laugh Love ™ of it all, but my tortilla was free today. Move over, NYC Marathon - a new bucket list item has appeared. 

This free tortilla, accompanied by a surfeit of rice, a sauté of deliciousness, and an aroma of intoxication provided that Lacanian jouissance that fuels life. A dish that has married the unbelievable to the undefeatable has served as an initiation into the cult of culinary Epicureanism. 
Dear Reader, at this point in the essay you may find yoruself wondeirng if this is too good to be true - where's the downside? Fret not, trouble lies ahead.

Unfortunately, what could only be described by some diners as “repetitive techno” music flooded our ears as we ate and dined, transforming the Chipotle into some milquetoast Williamsburg coffee shop. Imagine you were at a rave, but everyone's MDMA was laced with Vallium. That's the vibe. Luckily, the food is amazing so we can overlook this. 

You're done with your meal, it's a Friday night, you're on the Upper West Side. Where do you want to go now? How do you want to spend your night? Well, I live on the Upper West Side so come over. Or.... catch a film. 

> Conveniently located just a few steps from an AMC with reclining seats, combining this Chipotle location with a movie makes for a great time with friends or a casual date night.[*1] 

Now, there's nothing casual about my date nights, that's for sure. But.... the movies are THE de-facto location for any sort of romantic activity, and that's undeniable. Throw in reclining seats and we are COOKING.


This is a fantastically located Chipotle, an amazingly kind-hearted-free-tortilla-giving staff, a savoury experience, and it’s located right next to the cinema. If you’re able to overlook the music, and you’re able to brave the train (at night) to the Upper West Side, this Chipotle is the one for you.
