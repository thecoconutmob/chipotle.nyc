## review
Nestled far on the east-side of Manhattan, this Chipotle location proves to be an inconvenient one to get to if you don't already live close to the L. A brief commute - albeit one where you're required to switch trains - leads you to this Stuytown Chipotle. While the food itself was tasty and fresh, the poor quality of the side-tortilla and the average serving size leave a bad taste in your mouth, one that not even the appetizing guacamole can alleviate.
