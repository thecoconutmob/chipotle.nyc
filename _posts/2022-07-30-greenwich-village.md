## review

Located on the corner of 13th St and 6th Ave, this Chipotle ™ is a testament to the growing resistance against the encroaching corporate take-over of lower Manhattan. This one story casual eatery stands alone in defiance, surrounded by veritable skyscrapers in ever direction. 
Clean from the outside, the stark white facade lures in the passerby with the promise of a safe haven from the rats. After all, who amongst us in Manhattan would abnegate a bastion from the vermin that plague our city? 

You walk in - hoping for a good meal - and you're definitely going to get one.

The first thing you'll notice when you walk in is the seating - rather than the typical tables one might expect, you'll be greeted with clean steel high-tops. You'll head over to order and contemplate your menu options before deciding on the classic, a bowl with a tortilla on the side. 
 
The ingredients are super fresh - the fajitas a little too fresh, perhaps the only reason holding this location back from a 5/5. The quantities are by no means generous, and you might notice they skimped on your chicken. Nevertheless, it's far from a miserly portion and you feel content, if not awed by the heap of food in your bowl. The tortilla is perfection, not too crisp, perfectly heated, and wrapped in that shiny paper people use to heat potatoes. Yum. As you move to pay, you notice the bill.
 
Clocking in at 10¢ cheaper for a bowl than previous locations, you're taking this guac all the way to the bank. 
 
As you eat you notice two things simultaneously - the A.C. is popping off, an important note for the hot summer days that, if you're reading this, are now mostly over. The second, is the music. Not too EDM, but not not too EDM either. A perfect synth-pop blend that plays in the background while you dig into your bowl. 

Unfortunately, of the two bathrooms at this location, one was closed and the other was out of toilet paper. No worries, as it's not a far ride back to your place.... or mine. This location is one block away from the 1,2,3,F,M, and L lines. Mamma Mia that's well connected. There are some buses too, but we can wave at them as they go by. 

Overall, this Chipotle is definitely one of the best three we've visited!
